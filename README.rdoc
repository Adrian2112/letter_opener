= Letter Opener

Preview mail in your browser instead of sending it. When using the included delivery method, any sent mail will open automatically into the browser.

== Rails Setup

Add the gem to your development environment and run the +bundle+ command.

  gem "letter_opener", :group => :development

And then set the delivery method in <tt>config/environments/development.rb</tt>

  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener

Now any delivered mail will pop up in your browser. The messages are stored in <tt>tmp/letter_opener</tt>.


== Other Setup

This can be used with any environment that uses the Mail gem. Simply set the delivery method when configuring Mail and specify a location.

  require "letter_opener"
  Mail.defaults do
    delivery_method LetterOpener::DeliveryMethod, :location => "tmp/letter_opener"
  end
